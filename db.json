class=\"headerlink\" title=\"从一次生产事故说起\"></a>从一次生产事故说起</h2><p>2017年4月13日，腾讯高级工程师小圣在做充值业务时，修改了苹果iap支付配置，将JSON配置增加了重复的key。代码发布后，有小部分使用了vivo手机的用户反馈充值页面白屏，无法在Now app内进行充值。最后问题定位是：vivo手机使用了系统自带的webview而没有使用X5内核，解析JSON时遇到重复key报错，导致页面白屏。</p>\n<p>类似的问题其实很多： 比如变量未定义，方法被覆盖等等都会造成js代码执行时报错。那么如何避免呢？ESLint官方提供sharable config（可共享配置），前端团队可以根据自身团队情况定制ESLint规范配置。</p>\n<h2

href=\"#eslint-config-ivweb-介绍\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"eslint-config-ivweb 介绍\"></a>eslint-config-ivweb 介绍</h2><p> eslint-config-ivweb是腾讯NOW直播IVWEB团队的ESLint配置。目前发布初版，目前大约有130条规则，包含可能存在的错误、最佳实践、变量、代码风格、ES6相关等5个大的规则板块。</p>\n<p>仓库地址：<a href=\"https://github.com/feflow/eslint-config-ivweb\" target=\"_blank\"

title=\"项目接入使用\"></a>项目接入使用</h2><p>基本理念： 项目代码太多，不影响历史代码。只针对有改动的代码（.js和.jsx后缀）才进行校验。</p>\n<p>第一步：添加或者修改.eslintrc.js 配置文件</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td

放置在最后。部分eslint:recommend定义的规则有点严格，ivweb里面有做定制化的修改。</p>\n<p>第二步：增加precommit的hook和eslint-config-ivweb依赖</p>\n<p>此处我们使用husky来管理所有的Hook，同之前的commit message校验。</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight

为什么不直接使用airbnb团队的 eslint-config-airbnb？<br>A： airbnb官方的规则过于庞大，有10多个规则文件。维护起来成本较高，选择基于轻量级的 eslint:recommend 基础之上定制团队ESLint规则更加简单，也便于维护。</p>\n<p>Q： 我觉得eslint-config-ivweb有些规则不太合适，怎么办？<br>A：

为什么使用lint-staged？<br>A： lint-staged只会对修改过的js文件行数进行代码规范检查，不会对所有的代码检查，更加合理和可操作。</p>\n","site":{"data":{"languages":{"zh-cn":{"name":"简体中文","disqus_lang":"zh"}},"menu":{"docs":"/docs/"},"sidebar":{"docs":{"getting_started":{"overview":"index.html","commands":"commands.html"},"basic_usage":{"writing":"writing.html","tag_plugins":"tag-plugins.html"},"customization":{"permalinks":"permalinks.html","themes":"themes.html","eslint":"eslint.html"}}},"plugins":[{"name":"hexo-filter-mermaid-diagrams","description":"mermaid

href=\"https://eslint.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ESLint</a>于2013年6月份推出，至今4个年头，最新版本v4.8.0。它是目前主流的用于Javascript和JSX代码规范检查的利器，很多大公司比如<a href=\"https://github.com/airbnb/javascript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Airbnb</a>和<a href=\"https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google</a>均有一套自己的Javascript编码规范，而规范的实施背后离不开ESLint的支持。比如大名顶顶的<a href=\"https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eslint-config-airbnb</a>和<a href=\"https://github.com/google/eslint-config-google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eslint-config-google</a>。为了更好的统一团队的JS编程风格和代码质量。<a href=\"https://github.com/feflow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">feflow</a>官方经过调研和探索，终于迎来了ESLint的解决方案，最核心的理念是：基于eslint:recommend做规则的定制化。</p>\n<h2 id=\"从一次生产事故说起\"><a href=\"#从一次生产事故说起\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"从一次生产事故说起\"></a>从一次生产事故说起</h2><p>2017年4月13日，腾讯高级工程师小圣在做充值业务时，修改了苹果iap支付配置，将JSON配置增加了重复的key。代码发布后，有小部分使用了vivo手机的用户反馈充值页面白屏，无法在Now app内进行充值。最后问题定位是：vivo手机使用了系统自带的webview而没有使用X5内核，解析JSON时遇到重复key报错，导致页面白屏。</p>\n<p>类似的问题其实很多： 比如变量未定义，方法被覆盖等等都会造成js代码执行时报错。那么如何避免呢？ESLint官方提供sharable config（可共享配置），前端团队可以根据自身团队情况定制ESLint规范配置。</p>\n<h2

eslint-config-ivweb是腾讯NOW直播IVWEB团队的ESLint配置。目前发布初版，目前大约有130条规则，包含可能存在的错误、最佳实践、变量、代码风格、ES6相关等5个大的规则板块。</p>\n<p>仓库地址：<a href=\"https://github.com/feflow/eslint-config-ivweb\" target=\"_blank\"

title=\"项目接入使用\"></a>项目接入使用</h2><p>基本理念： 项目代码太多，不影响历史代码。只针对有改动的代码（.js和.jsx后缀）才进行校验。</p>\n<p>第一步：添加或者修改.eslintrc.js 配置文件</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td

放置在最后。部分eslint:recommend定义的规则有点严格，ivweb里面有做定制化的修改。</p>\n<p>第二步：增加precommit的hook和eslint-config-ivweb依赖</p>\n<p>此处我们使用husky来管理所有的Hook，同之前的commit message校验。</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight

为什么不直接使用airbnb团队的 eslint-config-airbnb？<br>A： airbnb官方的规则过于庞大，有10多个规则文件。维护起来成本较高，选择基于轻量级的 eslint:recommend 基础之上定制团队ESLint规则更加简单，也便于维护。</p>\n<p>Q： 我觉得eslint-config-ivweb有些规则不太合适，怎么办？<br>A： 欢迎提交issue讨论或者直接提交PR。仓库地址：<a href=\"https://github.com/feflow/eslint-config-ivweb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/feflow/eslint-config-ivweb</a></p>\n<p>Q： 为什么使用lint-staged？<br>A： lint-staged只会对修改过的js文件行数进行代码规范检查，不会对所有的代码检查，更加合理和可操作。</p>\n"},{"title":"Git提交规范","_content":"\n![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/l/doctrine/orm.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square)\n\n\n###

尾部：如果需要的化可以添加一个链接到issue地址或者其它文档，或者关闭某个issue。\n```\n\n### Git分支与版本发布规范\n\n* 基本原则：master为保护分支，不直接在master上进行代码修改和提交。\n* 开发日常需求或者项目时，从master分支上checkout一个feature分支进行开发或者bugfix分支进行bug修复，功能测试完毕并且项目发布上线后，`将feature分支合并到主干master，并且打Tag发布，最后删除开发分支`。分支命名规范：\n    * 分支版本命名规则：分支类型 _ 分支发布时间 _ 分支功能。比如：feature_20170401_fairy_flower\n    * 分支类型包括：feature、 bugfix、refactor三种类型，即新功能开发、bug修复和代码重构\n    * 时间使用年月日进行命名，不足2位补0\n    * 分支功能命名使用snake case命名法，即下划线命名。\n* Tag包括3位版本，前缀使用v。比如v1.2.31。Tag命名规范：\n    * 新功能开发使用第2位版本号，bug修复使用第3位版本号\n    * 核心基础库或者Node中间价可以在大版本发布请使用灰度版本号，在版本后面加上后缀，用中划线分隔。alpha或者belta后面加上次数，即第几次alpha：\n        * v2.0.0-alpha.1 \n        * v2.0.0-belta.1\n* 版本正式发布前需要生成changelog文档，然后再发布上线。\n\n### 如何接入？\n\n接入参考[git-commit-style-guide](https://github.com/feflow/git-commit-style-guide)项目。具体步骤如下：\n\n* 第一步：在工程跟目录下的package.json文件加入如下代码所示的scripts和dependencies内容，版本号为3位版本号。\n\n```sh\n  {\n    \"name\": \"application-name\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"scripts\": {\n      \"commitmsg\": \"validate-commit-msg\",\n      \"commit\": \"git-cz \",\n      \"changelog\": \"conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s -r 0\"\n    },\n    \"devDependencies\": {\n      \"commitizen\": \"^2.3.0\",\n      \"validate-commit-msg\": \"^2.11.1\",\n      \"conventional-changelog-cli\": \"^1.2.0\",\n      \"husky\": \"^0.13.1\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n* 第二步：在工程根目录新建.vcmrc文件，并且文件内容为\n\n```sh\n{\n  \"helpMessage\": \"\\nPlease fix your commit message (and consider using https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen)\\n\",\n  \"types\": [\n    \"feat\",\n    \"fix\",\n    \"docs\",\n    \"style\",\n    \"refactor\",\n    \"perf\",\n    \"test\",\n    \"chore\",\n    \"revert\"\n  ],\n  \"warnOnFail\": false,\n  \"autoFix\": false\n}\n```\n\n### 接入后的Git commit操作流程\n\n* 第一步：创建一个feature分支或者bugfix分支\n\n```sh\n  $ git checkout -b feature_infinite_load    # 切换到一个feature分支或者bug fix分支\n```\n\n* 第二步：将代码提交到本地Git仓库，并填写符合要求的Commit message格式\n\n```sh\n  $ git add .\n  $ git commit                               # 此处不要加任何参数，比如-m\n```\n\n  如下图所示：\n\n![](http://images2015.cnblogs.com/blog/1030776/201703/1030776-20170304153136563-2126734467.png)\n\n\n\n* 第三步：将代码同步到远程Git仓库\n\n```sh\n  $ git push origin feature_infinite_load    # 将修改发布到远程仓库 \n```\n\n* 第四步：自动生成changelog，并打Tag发布\n\n```sh\n  $ tnpm run changelog                    # 使用npm script中的changlog命令直接从git元数据生成日志。\n  $ git tag v0.1.0\n  $ git push origin

_ 分支发布时间 _ 分支功能。比如：feature_20170401_fairy_flower</li>\n<li>分支类型包括：feature、 bugfix、refactor三种类型，即新功能开发、bug修复和代码重构</li>\n<li>时间使用年月日进行命名，不足2位补0</li>\n<li>分支功能命名使用snake case命名法，即下划线命名。</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tag包括3位版本，前缀使用v。比如v1.2.31。Tag命名规范：<ul>\n<li>新功能开发使用第2位版本号，bug修复使用第3位版本号</li>\n<li>核心基础库或者Node中间价可以在大版本发布请使用灰度版本号，在版本后面加上后缀，用中划线分隔。alpha或者belta后面加上次数，即第几次alpha：<ul>\n<li>v2.0.0-alpha.1 </li>\n<li>v2.0.0-belta.1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>版本正式发布前需要生成changelog文档，然后再发布上线。</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"如何接入？\"><a href=\"#如何接入？\" class=\"headerlink\"

_ 分支发布时间 _ 分支功能。比如：feature_20170401_fairy_flower</li>\n<li>分支类型包括：feature、 bugfix、refactor三种类型，即新功能开发、bug修复和代码重构</li>\n<li>时间使用年月日进行命名，不足2位补0</li>\n<li>分支功能命名使用snake case命名法，即下划线命名。</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tag包括3位版本，前缀使用v。比如v1.2.31。Tag命名规范：<ul>\n<li>新功能开发使用第2位版本号，bug修复使用第3位版本号</li>\n<li>核心基础库或者Node中间价可以在大版本发布请使用灰度版本号，在版本后面加上后缀，用中划线分隔。alpha或者belta后面加上次数，即第几次alpha：<ul>\n<li>v2.0.0-alpha.1 </li>\n<li>v2.0.0-belta.1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>版本正式发布前需要生成changelog文档，然后再发布上线。</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"如何接入？\"><a href=\"#如何接入？\" class=\"headerlink\"

是由IVWEB团队开发的一款生成`now-activity`项目脚手架的插件 \n\n- generator-now-business: 是由IVWEB团队开发的一款生成`now-(h5|mobile|pc|web|app|qq)`项目脚手架的插件\n\n\n## 脚手架简介\n\n> 脚手架是指通过简单的指令帮助用户快速搭建好项目基本代码框架，从而减少重复性工作的工具。\n\n相信你已经关注到feflow内置的脚手架工具是以'generator-'开头命名的，这是因为feflow的脚手架是利用[Yeoman](https://yeoman.io)工具的`yeoman-generator`来扩展构建的。\n\n## feflow脚手架设计思路\n\n我们需要给每个工程类型的项目创建一个generator，按照目前前端技术栈的发展情况来看，一个团队一般会有3～5个generator。通过工具上层的CLI将generator类插件暴露给开发者使用。\n\n在generator之下，需要开发一系列服务和集成规范、包括与Git仓库打通，即通过脚手架初始化项目时，对开发者进行鉴权，之后根据开发者定义的项目名称在远程仓库里创建项目仓库并授予开发者权限。整体系统架构如下：\n\n![架构](http://7tszky.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/FiwG7VvpYL3Tleaii9Q9dowGNJXv)\n\n> 后续开发包括但不限于数据统计、分析各个业务仓库信息等功能。\n\n## 创建自定义generator\n\n开发者用户完全可以创建属于自己的脚手架，可以是简单的页面模板，亦可以是一套包含用户交互的量身定制的项目，这取决于开发者初始化的策略与需求。\n\n一起来创建一个generator脚手架吧！\n\n### 自定义目录结构\n\n开发者可以自定义模板目录，这里我们定义了一个`templates`模板目录，`index.js`为我们初始化项目的策略。\n\n```category\n├─── package.json\n└─── generators/\n     ├─── app/\n     |    ├─── templates/\n     |    |    ├─── src/\n     |    |    ├─── _cilintrc.js\n     |    |    ├─── _eslintrc.js\n     |    |    ├─── _fis-conf.js\n     |    |    ├─── _package.json\n     |    |    ├─── _project.js\n     |    |    ├─── _README.md\n     |    |    ├─── _editorconfig\n\t |    |    ├─── _gitignore\n\t |    |    └─── vcmrc\n\t |    └─── index.js\n\t └─── utils.js\n```\n\n```package.json\n{\n  \"name\": \"generator-demo\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"description\": \"生成自定义generator\",\n  \"files\": [\n    \"generators\"\n  ],\n  \"main\": \"generators/index.js\",       // 入口文件\n  \"keywords\": [\n    \"yeoman-generator\"\n  ],\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"yeoman-generator\": \"^1.0.1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`package.json`可通过`npm init`或手动创建生成，也可利用`generator-generator`初始化。\n\n!> name 必须以'generator-'开头，便于Yeoman依赖文件系统来寻找可用的generator。keywords属性必须包含'yeoman-generator'。\n\n\n### 初始化Generator\n\n通过继承Generator来扩展自定义的Generator，并将模块暴露给外部接口。\n\n```javascript\nconst Generator = require('yeoman-generator');\n\nmodule.exports = class extends Generator {\n\tconstructor(args, opts) {\n\t\tsuper(args, opts)\n\t}\n\t\n    /*\n\t * Generator 运行周期\n\t */\n\n\tinitializing() {   // 初始化方法，检查并获取当前项目状态配置\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\n\tprompting() {      // 与用户进行信息交互\n\t\t... \n\t\treturn this.prompt([\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'input',\n\t\t\t\tname: 'username',\n\t\t\t\tmessage: '请输入您的姓名：',\n\t\t\t\tdefault: 'feflow-user'\t\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'confirm',\n\t\t\t\tname: 'generator_ins',\n\t\t\t\tmessage: '是否对编程感兴趣',\n\t\t\t\tdefault: true\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]).then((answers) => {\n\t\t\tif(/\\d+/g.test(answers.username)) {\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log('姓名不能包含数字!');\n\t\t\t\treturn this.prompting()\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tconsole.log(`姓名：${answers.username}`);\n\t\t\tconsole.log('兴趣：编程');\n\t\t})\n\t}\n\n\tconfiguring() {    // 保存配置并通过创建.editorconfig文件和其他元数据文件来配置项目\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\n\tdefault() {        // 如果方法名未匹配优先级，则由default处理\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\n\twriting() {        // 处理模板\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\n\tconflicts() {      //

脚手架是指通过简单的指令帮助用户快速搭建好项目基本代码框架，从而减少重复性工作的工具。\n\n相信你已经关注到feflow内置的脚手架工具是以'generator-'开头命名的，这是因为feflow的脚手架是利用[Yeoman](https://yeoman.io)工具的`yeoman-generator`来扩展构建的。\n\n## feflow脚手架设计思路\n\n我们需要给每个工程类型的项目创建一个generator，按照目前前端技术栈的发展情况来看，一个团队一般会有3～5个generator。通过工具上层的CLI将generator类插件暴露给开发者使用。\n\n在generator之下，需要开发一系列服务和集成规范、包括与Git仓库打通，即通过脚手架初始化项目时，对开发者进行鉴权，之后根据开发者定义的项目名称在远程仓库里创建项目仓库并授予开发者权限。整体系统架构如下：\n\n![架构](http://7tszky.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/FiwG7VvpYL3Tleaii9Q9dowGNJXv)\n\n> 后续开发包括但不限于数据统计、分析各个业务仓库信息等功能。\n\n## 创建自定义generator\n\n开发者用户完全可以创建属于自己的脚手架，可以是简单的页面模板，亦可以是一套包含用户交互的量身定制的项目，这取决于开发者初始化的策略与需求。\n\n一起来创建一个generator脚手架吧！\n\n### 自定义目录结构\n\n开发者可以自定义模板目录，这里我们定义了一个`templates`模板目录，`index.js`为我们初始化项目的策略。\n\n```category\n├─── package.json\n└─── generators/\n     ├─── app/\n     |    ├─── templates/\n     |    |    ├─── src/\n     |    |    ├─── _cilintrc.js\n     |    |    ├─── _eslintrc.js\n     |    |    ├─── _fis-conf.js\n     |    |    ├─── _package.json\n     |    |    ├─── _project.js\n     |    |    ├─── _README.md\n

\"dependencies\": {\n    \"yeoman-generator\": \"^1.0.1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`package.json`可通过`npm init`或手动创建生成，也可利用`generator-generator`初始化。\n\n!> name 必须以'generator-'开头，便于Yeoman依赖文件系统来寻找可用的generator。keywords属性必须包含'yeoman-generator'。\n\n\n### 初始化Generator\n\n通过继承Generator来扩展自定义的Generator，并将模块暴露给外部接口。\n\n```javascript\nconst Generator =

I'm going to introduce them below.\n\n## Fragment Caching\n\nAlthough Hexo is fast, it may become slow if you have thousands of source files or complicated categories or tags. Before the data model upgraded, I borrowed a feature from Ruby on Rails: **Fragment Caching**.\n\nFragment Caching saves contents within a fragment and serves the cache when the next request come in. A fragment will only be processed once. It can reduce database queries and decrease generation time significantly. For instance, a Hexo site with 300+ source files needs 6 minutes to generate. In Hexo 2.7, it only need 10 seconds!\n\nIt can be used in header, footer, sidebar or static contents that won't be changed during generating. For example:\n\n``` js\n<%- fragment_cache('header', function(){\n  return '<header></header>';\n}); %>\n```\n\nBy using `fragment_cache` helper, contents in the function will be cached.\n\nPartial helper also supports Fragment Caching, you only need to add a `{cache: true}` option when using partial.\n\n``` js\n<%- partial('header', {}, {cache: true}) %>\n```\n\n[Landscape] is updated and supports Fragment Caching now.

But your theme needs some modifications to support it. However, it's not as hard as you think. You just need to replace the following contents in templates\n\n``` js\n<%- config.root %><%- path %>\n```\n\nwith `url_for` helper.\n\n``` js\n<%- url_for(path) %>\n```\n\n`url_for` helper will add `config.root` automatically for you. If you enable `relative_link` setting, it'll add a relative path.\n\n[Landscape] is updated for Relative Link.

[Connect] passes a request through functions called **middleware**. You can make response to the coming in request in middleware.\n\nIn Hexo, middleware is served as a type of filter. You can add middleware by registering a new filter. For example:\n\n``` js\nhexo.extend.filter.register('server_middleware', function(app){\n  app.use(function(req, res, next){\n    res.setHeader('X-Powered-By', 'Hexo');\n    next();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis middleware add a header `X-Powered-By` and passes the request to the next middleware.\n\n[Landscape]: https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape\n[Connect]: http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/\n[Express]: http://expressjs.com/","source":"_posts/2014-06-14-hexo-2-7-released.md","raw":"title: Hexo 2.7 Released\n---\nHexo 2.7 has been released with three new features. I'm going to introduce them below.\n\n## Fragment Caching\n\nAlthough Hexo is fast, it may become slow if you have thousands of source files or complicated categories or tags. Before the data model upgraded, I borrowed a feature from Ruby on Rails: **Fragment Caching**.\n\nFragment Caching saves contents within a fragment and serves the cache when the next request come in. A fragment will only be processed once. It can reduce database queries and decrease generation time significantly. For instance, a Hexo site with 300+ source files needs 6 minutes to generate. In Hexo 2.7, it only need 10 seconds!\n\nIt can be used in header, footer, sidebar or static contents that won't be changed during generating. For example:\n\n``` js\n<%- fragment_cache('header', function(){\n  return '<header></header>';\n}); %>\n```\n\nBy using `fragment_cache` helper, contents in the function will be cached.\n\nPartial helper also supports Fragment Caching, you only need to add a `{cache: true}` option when using partial.\n\n``` js\n<%- partial('header', {}, {cache: true}) %>\n```\n\n[Landscape] is updated and supports Fragment Caching now.

released with three new features. I’m going to introduce them below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Fragment-Caching\"><a href=\"#Fragment-Caching\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Fragment Caching\"></a>Fragment Caching</h2><p>Although Hexo is fast, it may become slow if you have thousands of source files or complicated categories or tags. Before the data model upgraded, I borrowed a feature from Ruby on Rails: <strong>Fragment Caching</strong>.</p>\n<p>Fragment Caching saves contents within a fragment and serves the cache when the next request come in. A fragment will only be processed once. It can reduce database queries and decrease generation time significantly. For instance, a Hexo site with 300+ source files needs 6 minutes to generate. In Hexo 2.7, it only need 10 seconds!</p>\n<p>It can be used in header, footer, sidebar or static contents that won’t be changed during generating. For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;%- fragment_cache(<span class=\"string\">'header'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\"></span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"string\">'&lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt;'</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;); %&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>By using <code>fragment_cache</code> helper, contents in the function will be cached.</p>\n<p>Partial helper also supports Fragment Caching, you only need to add a <code>{cache: true}</code> option when using partial.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;%- partial(<span class=\"string\">'header'</span>, &#123;&#125;, &#123;<span class=\"attr\">cache</span>: <span class=\"literal\">true</span>&#125;) %&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Landscape</a> is updated and supports Fragment Caching now. You can check <a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape/commit/d2aedda61571d6994eb72d784ceda2f59d2a8631\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this commit</a> to see what’s changed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Relative-Link\"><a href=\"#Relative-Link\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Relative Link\"></a>Relative Link</h2><p>Relative Link is supported since Hexo 2.7. But your theme needs some modifications to support it. However, it’s not as hard as you think. You just need to replace the following contents in templates</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;%- config.root %&gt;&lt;%- path %&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>with <code>url_for</code> helper.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;%- url_for(path) %&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p><code>url_for</code> helper will add <code>config.root</code> automatically for you. If you enable <code>relative_link</code> setting, it’ll add a relative path.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Landscape</a> is updated for Relative Link. You can check <a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape/commit/d29cbb83356373af27e7b98643f29a27804364af\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this commit</a> to see what’s changed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Server-Middleware\"><a href=\"#Server-Middleware\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Server Middleware\"></a>Server Middleware</h2><p>Server Middleware would be familiar if you have ever used <a href=\"http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Connect</a> or <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Express</a> before. <a href=\"http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Connect</a> passes a request through functions called <strong>middleware</strong>. You can make response to the coming in request in middleware.</p>\n<p>In Hexo, middleware is served as a type of filter. You can add middleware by registering a new filter. For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">hexo.extend.filter.register(<span class=\"string\">'server_middleware'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">app</span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  app.use(<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">req, res, next</span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    res.setHeader(<span class=\"string\">'X-Powered-By'</span>, <span class=\"string\">'Hexo'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    next();</span><br><span class=\"line\">  &#125;);</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>This middleware add a header <code>X-Powered-By</code> and passes the request to the next middleware.</p>\n"},{"title":"Hexo 2.8 Released","_content":"Hexo 2.8 was rewritten, brings you better performance and many improvements. The following is the highlights in this version. You can check [detail](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/releases/tag/2.8.0) on GitHub.\n\n## Faster Processing Speed\n\nBefore Hexo 2.8, all source files have to be processed each time you use Hexo. In Hexo 2.8, the entire database will be saved to `db.json` so Hexo don't have to process all files again. Also, a new data type \"**skip**\" was added for processors to detect whether a file was changed or not.\n\nGenerating was also changed in Hexo 2.8. You can check the elapsed time of each file in console now. However, I found multi-process generating didn't affect generating speed a lot. Thus, `multi_thread` and `max_open_file` setting are deprecated in Hexo 2.8.\n\n{% asset_img generate-console.png %}\n\n## Draft Publish\n\nYou don't have to enter full file name to publish a post anymore. Draft publish system is rewritten in Hexo 2.8. `new_post_name` setting will be applied until drafts are published. Besides, you can choose which layout to apply when publishing.\n\n``` bash\n$ hexo publish [layout] <filename>\n```\n\nA new API `post.publish` was added to help you publish drafts more easily.\n\n``` js\nhexo.post.publish({slug: 'hello-world', layout: 'post'}, function(err, target){\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## Permalink\n\nFile name and permalink now share a more universal variable system. Every variables in file name can also be read in permalink. Here's a config for example:\n\n``` yaml\npermalink: :type/:title/\nnew_post_name: :type/:title.md\n```\n\nWhen you create a post, the post will be saved to `source/_posts/test/Hello-World.md` and the URL will be `http://localhost:4000/test/Hello-World/`.\n\n``` bash\n$ hexo new \"Hello World\" --type test\n```\n\n## Multi-language Support\n\nWith the new permalink introduced in the previous section, it's much easier to create a multi-language site. For example:\n\n``` yaml\npermalink: :lang/:title/\nnew_post_name: :lang/:title.md\n```\n\nThen you can create a post with `--lang` option:\n\n``` bash\n$ hexo new \"Hello World\" --lang en\n# => This post will be saved to source/_posts/en/Hello-World.md\n# => URL: http://localhost:4000/en/Hello-World/\n\n$ hexo new \"你好世界\" --lang tw\n# => This post will be saved to source/_posts/tw/你好世界.md\n# => URL: http://localhost:4000/tw/你好世界/\n```\n\nYou can define the default value of permalink variables in `permalink_defaults` setting.

brings you better performance and many improvements. The following is the highlights in this version. You can check <a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/releases/tag/2.8.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">detail</a> on GitHub.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Faster-Processing-Speed\"><a href=\"#Faster-Processing-Speed\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Faster Processing Speed\"></a>Faster Processing Speed</h2><p>Before Hexo 2.8, all source files have to be processed each time you use Hexo. In Hexo 2.8, the entire database will be saved to <code>db.json</code> so Hexo don’t have to process all files again. Also, a new data type “<strong>skip</strong>“ was added for processors to detect whether a file was changed or not.</p>\n<p>Generating was also changed in Hexo 2.8. You can check the elapsed time of each file in console now. However, I found multi-process generating didn’t affect generating speed a lot. Thus, <code>multi_thread</code> and <code>max_open_file</code> setting are deprecated in Hexo 2.8.</p>\n<img src=\"/news/2014/07/13/hexo-2-8-released/generate-console.png\">\n<h2 id=\"Draft-Publish\"><a href=\"#Draft-Publish\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Draft Publish\"></a>Draft Publish</h2><p>You don’t have to enter full file name to publish a post anymore. Draft publish system is rewritten in Hexo 2.8. <code>new_post_name</code> setting will be applied until drafts are published. Besides, you can choose which layout to apply when publishing.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">$ hexo publish [layout] &lt;filename&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>A new API <code>post.publish</code> was added to help you publish drafts more easily.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">hexo.post.publish(&#123;<span class=\"attr\">slug</span>: <span class=\"string\">'hello-world'</span>, <span class=\"attr\">layout</span>: <span class=\"string\">'post'</span>&#125;, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">err, target</span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"comment\">// ...</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Permalink\"><a href=\"#Permalink\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>Permalink</h2><p>File name and permalink now share a more universal variable system. Every variables in file name can also be read in permalink. Here’s a config for example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">permalink:</span> <span class=\"string\">:type/:title/</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">new_post_name:</span> <span class=\"string\">:type/:title.md</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>When you create a post, the post will be saved to <code>source/_posts/test/Hello-World.md</code> and the URL will be <code>http://localhost:4000/test/Hello-World/</code>.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">$ hexo new <span class=\"string\">\"Hello World\"</span> --<span class=\"built_in\">type</span> <span class=\"built_in\">test</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Multi-language-Support\"><a href=\"#Multi-language-Support\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Multi-language Support\"></a>Multi-language Support</h2><p>With the new permalink introduced in the previous section, it’s much easier to create a multi-language site. For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">permalink:</span> <span class=\"string\">:lang/:title/</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">new_post_name:</span> <span class=\"string\">:lang/:title.md</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Then you can create a post with <code>--lang</code> option:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">$ hexo new <span class=\"string\">\"Hello World\"</span> --lang en</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; This post will be saved to source/_posts/en/Hello-World.md</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; URL: http://localhost:4000/en/Hello-World/</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">$ hexo new <span class=\"string\">\"你好世界\"</span> --lang tw</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; This post will be saved to source/_posts/tw/你好世界.md</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; URL: http://localhost:4000/tw/你好世界/</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>You can define the default value of permalink variables in <code>permalink_defaults</code> setting. For example, we define the defualt language as English.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">permalink_defaults:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">  lang:</span> <span class=\"string\">en</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>"},{"title":"Hexo 3.0 Released","_content":"Hexo 3.0 has finally come out!
